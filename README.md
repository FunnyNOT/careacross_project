# CareAcross Project

## üìå Overview
The **CareAcross Project** is a Django-based application that fetches **Todo** data from an external API when the database is empty, saves them in PostgreSQL, and displays them in a UI. Users can view todos and update their **completed status**.

## üéØ Target Audience
This project is an **assignment** and serves as a demonstration of working with external APIs, Django ORM, and Dockerized development.

---

## üöÄ Technology Stack
The project is built using:
- **Django** (Backend)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend UI)
- **PostgreSQL** (Database)
- **Docker** (Containerized development)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions

The project uses **Docker Compose** and a **Makefile** for easy setup. To install and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites


#### All tests were done on **Ubuntu 24.04**. If you need any assistance please do let me know via email.

  1.  ```Docker```
  2.  ```Docker - Compose```
  3.  ```Python 3.11^```
  4.  ```Python 3 setuptools```
  5.  ```Make```  For easier access to commands using the Makefile in the root of the project
  6.  ```.env values``` Granted via email request


### 

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FunnyNOT/careacross_project.git
   cd careacross_project
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   ##### Copy the example .env file:
    ```sh
    cp env.example .env
    ```

   ##### Update .env with your own values:
    ```sh
    SECRET_KEY=<django-secret-key>
    DEBUG=<django-debug>
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=<django-allowed-hosts>
    DATABASE_STRING=<django-database-string>
    TODO_API_URL=<todo-api-url>
    ```


3. **Build and run the project using Docker Compose:**

    ```sh
    make build
    make up
    ```
    ##### Run database migrations:
    ```sh
    make migrate
    ```



## üìå Usage Instructions
Once the project is running:

View Todos ‚Üí Access the UI to see all todos categorized here:
```http://localhost:8000/```

## All Todos
1. Completed Todos
2. Pending Todos
3. Update Todos ‚Üí Change the completed status of any todo.

## üß™ Running Tests
To run the test suite:

1. Ensure containers are running:

    ```sh
    make up
    ```

2. Run tests:

    ```sh
    make test
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment Variables

### The following environment variables need to be set (stored in .env):
    
    SECRET_KEY	    # Django secret key
    DEBUG	        # Django debug mode (True/False)
    ALLOWED_HOSTS	# Allowed hosts for Django
    DATABASE_STRING	# PostgreSQL connection string
    TODO_API_URL	# External API URL for fetching todos

## üîß Makefile Commands
The project includes a Makefile for simplified development tasks:

### Command	Description:

| Commands              | Description |
| -----------           | ----------- |
| make build            | Build Docker images|
| make down	            | Stop and remove containers|
| make up               | Start the containers|
| make logs             | View application logs|
| make restart          | Restart the containers|
| make migrate          | Apply database migrations|
| make collectstatic    | Collect Django static files|
| make shell	        | Open a Bash shell inside the backend container|
| make dbshell          | Open a psql shell in the database container|
| make format           | Format code using black and isort|
| make lint             | Run ruff for linting|
| make format_lint      | Format and lint in one go|
| make test             | Run Django tests|


## üìè Code Style & Linting
The project follows PEP8 and uses:

- Black (Code formatting)
- Isort (Import sorting)
- Ruff (Linting)
- To apply formatting and linting:

    ```sh
    make format_lint
    ```

## üöÄ Improvements & Future Work

While the project meets its current requirements, there are several areas for future improvements and enhancements:

### Testing & Code Quality

  1. Enhanced Test Coverage: Increase unit and integration tests to cover more edge cases, including error handling and retry logic.
  2. Automated CI/CD: Integrate continuous integration (CI) tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automate testing, linting, and code formatting on every push.
  3. Error Handling & Logging

### Production-Ready Server: 

   1. Transition from Django‚Äôs development server to a production-ready WSGI/ASGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, Daphne, or Uvicorn) for better performance.
   2. Separate Production Docker Configuration: Create a production Dockerfile and corresponding Compose configurations that include performance optimizations and security enhancements.
   3. User Interface & User Experience

### Enhanced Frontend: 

  1. Consider improving the UI/UX with a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue) or by refining the existing HTML/CSS/JS.
  2. Accessibility & Responsiveness: Enhance the application‚Äôs design to ensure it is fully accessible and responsive across devices.

### Security

1. Security Hardening: Regularly review and update dependencies, enforce secure coding practices, and perform vulnerability scans.
2. Environment Configuration: Use secrets management tools (or Docker secrets) to secure sensitive environment variables in production.


### Documentation

1. Detailed Developer Guide: Expand the documentation to include more details on the project architecture, development workflows, and troubleshooting common issues.
2. API Documentation: Provide clear documentation for any external or internal APIs, possibly with tools like Swagger or Redoc.
